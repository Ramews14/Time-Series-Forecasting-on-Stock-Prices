## Project Description
The LSTM Stock Price Prediction project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of LSTM networks in forecasting stock prices. By preprocessing historical stock data and training a model, this project provides insights into how machine learning can be applied in finance.

### Objectives
- Preprocess historical stock price data for LSTM input.
- Construct and train an LSTM model to forecast stock prices.
- Visualize and analyze the model's performance on test data.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
